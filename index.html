            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p class="para">
                Subhas Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, India, to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. 
                His father was a successful lawyer and his mother was a devout follower of the Hindu goddess Kali. 
                Bose was the ninth child in a family of 14 children.
                <br><br>Bose completed his early education at an Anglo-Indian school in Cuttack and later went to Ravenshaw Collegiate School. 
                In 1913, he moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) to pursue higher studies. 
                He studied at Presidency College and later at the University of Calcutta, where he obtained a degree in Philosophy.
                <br><br>In 1937, Bose married Emilie Schenkl, an Austrian woman whom he had met while studying in Europe. They had a daughter named Anita Bose Pfaff. Emilie and Anita lived in Austria, while Bose traveled extensively for his political work.
                <br><br>Bose was an active member of the Indian National Congress and served as the president of the party in 1938 and 1939. He was a strong supporter of complete independence from British rule and disagreed with the party's approach of seeking dominion status within the British Empire.
                <br><br>Bose was jailed by the British government several times for his political activities. In 1940, he was put under house arrest in Calcutta, but he managed to escape and flee to Germany, where he sought help from the Nazis to form an army to fight against the British.

                During his time in Germany and later in Japan, Bose continued to work towards Indian independence and formed the Indian National Army (INA), which fought alongside the Japanese army against the British in Burma and Northeast India.
                <br><br>In August 1945, Bose was reportedly killed in a plane crash in Taiwan, although there are conspiracy theories that suggest that he may have survived and lived in hiding. Bose remains a controversial figure in Indian history, with some hailing him as a hero and others criticizing his alliance with the Nazis and the Japanese.

                Despite the controversy surrounding his life and death, Bose's contribution to the Indian freedom movement is widely acknowledged. He remains a symbol of India's struggle for independence and is remembered for his fierce determination, courage, and patriotism.
